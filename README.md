# WeatherForecast

This application provides user with weather forecast for next 5 days with 3 hour interval basing on user's searched place.

This application demonstrates usage of MVVM architecture, URLSession and UITableView delegate and datasource methods.

Usage of application is self explanatory from the user interface. Run the application choosing any simulator running on latest XCode and enter a location to search. Results will be displayed in UITableView.

Scope for improvements includes modifying user interface to present the weather details in a better way and placing a loader when service call is in progress.
